Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

Write New Stories
-----------------

Pyschool could always use more stories, whether as specific python features,
existing libraries, programming concepts, or even programming concepts not
specific to Python itself like event handling, threading and such. New stories
are always welcome :)

Please read the README_ file to learn more about writing new stories.

Bugs and Feedback
-----------------

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/pyschool/pyschool.github.io/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)
